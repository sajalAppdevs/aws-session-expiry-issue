# AWS Session Expiry Issue - Flutter App

A Flutter application demonstrating proper handling of AWS session token expiration in mobile applications. This project implements best practices for managing AWS credentials and session tokens in a Flutter-based mobile app.

## Overview

This application addresses common challenges in handling AWS session tokens in mobile applications, including:
- Automatic token refresh before expiration
- Secure storage of credentials
- Graceful handling of session timeouts
- User session management

## Features

- AWS session token management
- Secure credential storage
- Automatic token refresh mechanism
- Session expiry notifications
- Error handling for expired sessions

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (latest stable version)
- AWS Account and credentials
- Android Studio / VS Code with Flutter plugins
- Basic understanding of AWS services and authentication

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-session-expiry-issue.git
   cd aws-session-expiry-issue
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root
   - Add your AWS configuration (ensure this file is in .gitignore)

## AWS Configuration

This project implements AWS session management following these best practices:

- Secure storage of refresh tokens in platform-specific secure storage
- Implementation of token refresh before expiration
- Proper error handling for invalid or expired sessions
- Session duration configuration based on security requirements

## Development

To run the application in development mode:

```bash
flutter run
```

## Security Considerations

- Tokens are stored securely using platform-specific secure storage
- Session durations are configured based on security requirements
- Refresh tokens are handled securely to prevent unauthorized access
- Proper error handling for security-related issues
